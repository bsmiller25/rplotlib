# R_plot_lib

This package contains functions that expand on R's base plotting features.

These functions were originally written while I was an employee at the
Federal Reserve Board and are therefore in the public domain. These functions were used in order to produce "Board Style" exhibits. 

To test the package, install locally by running at the command line:

R --no-init-file CMD INSTALL -l /your/local/R/library /your/git/repo/rplotlib

Then, in R:

library(mma, lib.loc = "/your/local/R/library")
